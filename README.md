# SVM_on_RO-PUF
This repo describes the learning of challenge-response pairs of an RO-PUF using Support Vector Machines implementing RBF kernel
Note : Jupyter cannot plot the graphs for decision boundaries well, so I have separately included the Training and Test learning plots as png files in my repo
